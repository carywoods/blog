In a modern-day narrative of reclamation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has embarked on a journey to re-establish the doctrine of “net neutrality,” a principle advocating for the open and equal treatment of internet traffic, irrespective of its source. The stance towards net neutrality has been a pendulum swing, with the FCC’s approach from early 2015 to 2017 being pro-net neutrality, which shifted during the tenure of Trump-era FCC chair Ajit Pai. However, with a Democratic majority now steering the agency, the sails are set towards reinstating this fundamental principle.

The recent endeavors of the FCC are a reflection of a broader progressive ideology that sees the internet as a democratized space, essential for modern-day discourse and societal advancement. Under the stewardship of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC has shown a renewed commitment to restoring net neutrality. On September 27, 2023, Rosenworcel announced that the FCC’s October meeting would deliberate on her plan to restore net neutrality, showcasing a pivotal step towards reversing the 2017 repeal of net neutrality regulations.

This progressive stride didn’t materialize out of thin air; it was a concerted effort stemming from a higher echelon of governance. President Biden, in July 2021, signed an executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the net neutrality rules initially adopted under the Obama administration, underscoring the significant political backing behind this move.

The FCC’s agenda transcends mere regulatory reinstatement. It echoes a wider progressive sentiment that perceives broadband access akin to essential utilities like water or electricity. The new net neutrality push under Chairwoman Rosenworcel aims to reclassify broadband access as an essential service, reflecting a profound understanding of the internet’s role in modern society.

The corporate realm is not detached from these regulatory oscillations. Notable entities like Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), AT&amp;T (T), and Verizon (VZ) are on the radar as the implications of net neutrality regulations could reshape the broadband landscape. AT&amp;T’s CEO, John Stankey, expressed a willingness to engage constructively with the FCC, albeit with a caveat against archaic regulatory applications on the modern-day internet.

As the FCC galvanizes its efforts, rallying a 3-2 vote along party lines to seek public commentary on the proposed net neutrality rules on October 19, 2023, the narrative is clear. The progressive endeavor to re-establish net neutrality is not merely a regulatory whim but a profound statement on the democratic essence of the internet, underscoring a modern-day progressive agenda to reclaim the internet as a space of equal opportunity for all.

The stakes are high, and the journey is emblematic of a broader progressive ethos resonating through the corridors of power, from the White House to the FCC, encapsulating a vision of a democratized digital realm conducive to societal advancement.
