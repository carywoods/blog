If you are feeling frustrated by the looming threat of a government shutdown over the debt ceiling, you are not alone. Millions of Americans are wondering how their country got into this mess, and what can be done to fix it. But before you lose all hope, there is one person who might have some answers: Alexander Hamilton.

Hamilton, as you may recall from your history classes or the hit musical, was one of the founding fathers of the United States and the first Secretary of the Treasury. He was also a visionary economist who helped shape the nation’s financial system and establish its creditworthiness. He faced many challenges and controversies in his time, but he always had a clear vision of what was best for the country and its future.

So what would Hamilton do if he were alive today and faced with the prospect of a government shutdown? Here are some possible scenarios:

- He would negotiate with Congress and the President to raise the debt ceiling and avoid defaulting on the nation’s obligations. He would argue that honoring the public debt is essential for maintaining the trust and confidence of creditors, investors, and allies. He would also point out that defaulting would have disastrous consequences for the economy, such as higher interest rates, lower growth, and reduced access to capital.
- He would propose a comprehensive plan to reduce the deficit and balance the budget over time. He would advocate for a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases, based on the principle of “a sound and steady currency”. He would favor reforms that would boost productivity, innovation, and trade, such as investing in infrastructure, education, and research. He would also support measures that would promote social justice and equality, such as progressive taxation, welfare programs, and anti-corruption laws.
- He would rally public opinion and mobilize popular support for his plan. He would use his eloquence and charisma to persuade people of the necessity and benefits of his proposals. He would also enlist the help of influential allies, such as newspapers, banks, and civic groups. He would appeal to the common sense and patriotism of Americans, and remind them of their shared values and goals.
- He would challenge his opponents and expose their flaws and motives. He would not shy away from confrontation or compromise, but he would also seek to find common ground and build consensus. He would expose the hypocrisy and self-interest of those who oppose his plan, such as partisan politicians, special interest groups, and foreign adversaries. He would also defend his reputation and integrity against any personal attacks or slander.

In short, Hamilton would do what he always did: act with courage, wisdom, and vision. He would not let petty politics or narrow interests get in the way of his duty to serve the nation and its people. He would not let fear or despair cloud his judgment or dampen his spirit. He would not let a government shutdown happen on his watch.

He would be Alexander Hamilton.
