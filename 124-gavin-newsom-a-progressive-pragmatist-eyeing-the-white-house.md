In the heart of California, where tech moguls and Hollywood stars coalesce, Governor Gavin Newsom is quietly laying the groundwork for a presidential run that could come as soon as 2028. A Democrat with a penchant for both progressive and pragmatic policies, Newsom is a study in political complexity, a leader who defies easy categorization.

#### A Man of Many Roles

Before ascending to the governorship, Newsom served as the Mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. He gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, defying federal law at the time. Newsom’s business background—he co-founded 11 companies in the hospitality industry—also adds a layer of complexity to his political persona.

#### Left Turn on Wages &amp; Right on Labor

In a move that thrilled progressives and labor activists, Newsom recently signed legislation raising the minimum wage for fast-food workers to $20 an hour, the highest in the nation. The decision was hailed as a victory for the working class, a bold step toward economic equality in a state where the cost of living is notoriously high.

“California is setting the standard for the rest of the country,” Newsom declared at a press conference, flanked by fast-food workers who had campaigned for the wage increase. “It’s time we recognize the dignity of work and the importance of a living wage.”

Yet, Newsom’s record is not uniformly progressive. Just days after the wage increase, he vetoed a bill that would have provided unemployment benefits to striking workers, a decision that puzzled many of his liberal supporters. The veto was seen as a nod to business interests, a signal that Newsom is willing to break with his party’s base when he deems it necessary.

In a statement explaining the veto, Newsom said, “While I support the right to strike, it’s important that we maintain a balanced approach to labor relations.”

#### Breaking Barriers in the Senate

Adding another layer to his complex political persona, Newsom made headlines by appointing Laphonza Butler, an openly gay Black woman, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Dianne Feinstein. The appointment was lauded as a historic moment for representation in American politics, and it solidified Newsom’s credentials as a champion of diversity and inclusion.

So what does this all mean for Newsom’s presidential ambitions? His policy decisions suggest a leader who is both progressive and pragmatic, a politician who is willing to take risks but also keen to maintain a broad appeal.

I used to think Newsom was playing a long game but He’s positioning himself as a unifying figure, someone who can speak to both the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and more moderate voters right now.

Indeed, Newsom’s triangulation strategy could serve him well in a presidential run, where the ability to build coalitions is often the key to victory. But it also carries risks. In a political climate increasingly defined by polarization, the middle ground can be a perilous place to stand.

#### Thoughts

As Gavin Newsom navigates the intricate landscape of California politics, he is also, whether implicitly or explicitly, auditioning for the national stage. His recent policy decisions reflect a nuanced approach to governance, one that defies easy ideological labels.

Whether this complexity is an asset or a liability in a presidential run remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Newsom is a politician to watch, a leader whose ambitions extend far beyond the Golden State.
