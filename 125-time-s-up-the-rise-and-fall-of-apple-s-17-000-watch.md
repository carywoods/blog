Ah, the first-generation Apple Watch. Remember that? The wrist-worn marvel that promised to change the way we interact with time, space, and our own heartbeats. It was the epitome of luxury and innovation, especially the 18-karat gold Edition model that cost as much as a small car. But alas, the golden child of Apple’s eye has now been officially declared “obsolete.” Yes, you read that right. The device that once made you feel like James Bond meets Warren Buffet is now as relevant as a Blockbuster membership card.

The Midas Touch, Now Tarnished
------------------------------

Apple has always had the Midas touch, turning everything it lays its hands on into gold—or at least into something that can be sold at a golden price. But it seems even Midas needs to update his iOS now and then. The first-generation Apple Watch, including its 18-karat gold Edition, has been left in the dust as Apple focuses on newer, shinier, and—let’s be honest—less golden gadgets.

Planned Obsolescence or Just the Circle of Life?
------------------------------------------------

If you were one of the elite few who shelled out $10,000 to $17,000 for the gold Edition, you might be feeling a bit like King Midas himself—rich, but unable to interact with the world in a meaningful way. Your golden Apple Watch can no longer receive software updates, and its functionality is as limited as a flip phone from the early 2000s. But hey, at least it still tells time, right? And it’s a great conversation starter at parties, especially if the topic is “tech investments I regret.” Apple’s move to declare the first-gen watch obsolete is a stark reminder of the transient nature of tech. One moment you’re on top of the world, taking calls on your wrist like a sci-fi billionaire; the next, you’re scouring eBay for a compatible charger that’s no longer in production. It’s the circle of life, Silicon Valley style.

The Golden Lesson
-----------------

So what can we learn from the rise and fall of the golden Apple Watch? Perhaps it’s that even the shiniest, most luxurious gadgets can’t escape the relentless march of progress. Or maybe it’s a cautionary tale about the perils of mixing fashion with technology. Either way, if you’re wearing a first-gen Apple Watch, it’s officially retro now. And if it’s the gold Edition, well, you’ve got yourself a very expensive, somewhat functional piece of tech history.

In the end, the golden Apple Watch serves as a timeless (or should we say “out-of-time”?) reminder that all that glitters is not gold—or at least, not forever.
