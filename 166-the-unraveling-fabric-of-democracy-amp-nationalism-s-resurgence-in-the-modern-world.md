In recent years, a seismic shift has shaken the global political landscape. Nationalist and populist movements, once relegated to the fringes of political discourse, have surged to the forefront, reshaping governments and societies alike. This global trend, characterized by an undercurrent of frustration and disenchantment, signals a profound transformation in how nations perceive themselves and their place in the world order.

1\. The Global Expansion of Authoritarianism: A Warning Signal  
The Freedom House report on the global expansion of authoritarian rule paints a concerning picture of democracy under siege. The report highlights a disturbing trend: autocracies gaining ground over democracies, with more countries experiencing declines in political rights and civil liberties than improvements. Notably, nations like China and Russia have asserted greater power in the international arena, challenging established democratic norms and contributing to a global shift toward authoritarianism.

**2. Nationalism’s New Face: From Brexit to Trump**  
From the Brexit campaign to the rise of figures like Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, a wave of nationalism has swept across continents, driven by deep-seated grievances over immigration, job losses, and a perceived erosion of national identity. These movements represent a radical departure from traditional political systems, fueled by citizens’ outrage over perceived neglect and corruption. National-populist leaders have capitalized on this sentiment, advocating for a return to a glorified past and stringent control over borders and immigration.

**3. The Role of Social Media and Disinformation**  
Modern technology, especially social media, has played a pivotal role in the rise of nationalism and populism. These platforms have become arenas for emotional and often irrational political discourse, where disinformation can thrive and sway public opinion. Additionally, external actors, like China and Saudi Arabia, have reportedly exploited these platforms to push specific ideologies, further complicating the landscape.

**4. The Challenge of Addressing Root Causes**  
Addressing the root causes of nationalist sentiment is crucial. Issues like income inequality, global economic anxieties, and the impacts of free trade have legitimate bases but are often hijacked by nationalist leaders who propose simplistic or misleading solutions. Immigration, in particular, has been a significant driver of nationalist fervor, with leaders exploiting fears around undocumented workers and cultural change.

**5. The Diverse Spectrum of Nationalism**  
National-populist movements are not monolithic. While united in their reaction against globalism, these movements vary significantly in their ideologies and approaches. In some countries, they reflect a reaction against domestic policies, while in others, they are a response to global phenomena like free trade, migratory flows, and technological changes that benefit some at the expense of others.

**6. The Future of National-Populism: Not Invincible**  
Despite their current prominence, national-populist movements are not invincible. They face setbacks when their governance performances do not meet expectations. The quality of democracy, however, is declining in many parts of the world, and traditional conservative parties, in some cases, have begun to adopt the rhetoric and policies of these radical movements, a development that could have lasting consequences for democratic institutions【64†source】.

The resurgence of nationalism and populism is a multifaceted issue that requires nuanced understanding and response. As these movements continue to shape global politics, it becomes increasingly crucial to analyze and address the underlying causes that fuel them. Only by confronting these root issues can democracies hope to navigate these turbulent waters and preserve the core values of freedom and pluralism.
