In a world where technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, the concept of planned obsolescence has become a hot topic of discussion. Planned obsolescence refers to the deliberate design of products to have a limited useful life, ensuring that consumers will need to replace or upgrade them after a certain period. While this strategy can drive sales and keep companies competitive, it also raises ethical and environmental concerns.

Recently, Google made headlines by announcing its decision to extend the life of Chromebooks by an additional two years. This move, as reported by PCMag, comes amidst complaints and concerns about the short lifespan of these devices. But is this a step in the right direction?

**Balancing Durability with Environmental Concerns**

James Blythe, in his insightful Medium article, sheds light on the challenges faced by product engineers. Designing a product to last longer often means using materials that are difficult to reprocess and dispose of. Materials like hexavalent chrome, crystalline silica, cadmium, and lead are excellent for enhancing product durability, but they pose significant environmental and health risks at the end of their life cycle.

Blythe points out that products designed to last longer are not only more challenging to break down in the environment but also come with other adverse effects. This presents a dilemma for engineers: how to balance the need for durability with the environmental impact?

**The Cost of “Forever Products”**

Another aspect to consider is the cost associated with designing products that last “forever.” Such products require rigorous design, testing, and validation processes. For instance, while polymeric adhesives are cost-effective and robust, they make products like shoes non-repairable once the adhesive wears out. On the other hand, making shoes resole-able requires more expensive processes, such as sewing or mechanical fastening.

**The Silver Lining of Planned Obsolescence**

While planned obsolescence often gets a bad rap, Blythe highlights its potential benefits. By defining a serviceable life for a product, engineers can design more effective, cost-efficient items. This not only maximizes market competitiveness but also ensures customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, planned obsolescence aligns well with the circular economy, prompting engineers to consider a product’s entire lifecycle. Scheduled obsolescence or upgrade events can ensure consumers always have access to the latest features while managing waste streams regularly.

Contrary to popular belief, companies do care about product end-of-life. It presents an opportunity to reclaim waste products, refurbish devices for secondary markets, and recycle products to reduce energy waste and the need for raw materials. This approach can lead to reduced manufacturing waste, resulting in cost savings and more affordable products for consumers.

**Thoughts**

Google’s decision to extend the lifespan of Chromebooks is a commendable move, reflecting a growing awareness of the need to balance business strategies with ethical and environmental considerations. While planned obsolescence has its merits, it’s essential for companies to continually evaluate their practices in light of evolving consumer needs and environmental challenges. After all, in the age of sustainability, the longevity of products and responsible end-of-life management are more crucial than ever.
