Music is a palette of emotions and has the power to transcend boundaries and touch the very essence of our being. Each musician is a storyteller, articulating the spectrum of human experience through melody and rhythm. Among an eclectic myriad of artists, these resonate more deeply with me than most, transporting to different realms of thought and feeling. In this post, I share some of my favorite yet underappreciated artists.

Keb Mo’, born Kevin Moore, is a purveyor of modern-day blues with a touch of pop, folk, and rock. His distinct style is often seen as a bridge between the Delta Blues and contemporary music, making the genre accessible to newer audiences. His self-titled album “Keb’ Mo’” released in 1994, was a rejuvenation of the old Delta Blues spirit in a modern-day setting. Songs like “Every Morning” and “Am I Wrong” have an easy-going melody but carry the profound, introspective lyricism characteristic of blues. Keb Mo’s music is like a comforting dialogue with the past, acknowledging the roots while embracing the present. His ability to intertwine simplistic storytelling with profound emotional experiences makes him a unique voice in the blues genre.
