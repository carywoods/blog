In an era where political polarization seems to be the norm rather than the exception, the experiences of Rajiv Shah, a former administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under President Obama, offer a refreshing perspective. Michael Schaffer’s brilliant, recent article in Politico delves into Shah’s unconventional approach to winning bipartisan support for foreign aid initiatives.

#### The Apology Tour

Shah’s initial foray into the political arena was met with resistance, especially from Republicans. After making a statement that proposed GOP budget cuts could lead to 70,000 additional child deaths, Shah found himself on an “apology tour,” meeting with Republican members of Congress. The traditional arguments for foreign aid, such as national security and economic benefits, were not resonating. Instead of relying solely on these conventional justifications, Shah took an unexpected route: he engaged in conversations about faith, charity, and shared values. Introduced to Senator Jim Inhofe, a conservative from Oklahoma, by a mutual friend, Shah began to attend Senate prayer breakfasts. This faith-based approach not only helped him deepen relationships across the aisle but also successfully defended his budget from cuts.

#### The Power of Shared Values

Shah’s experience underscores the importance of finding common ground in an increasingly divided political landscape. His story is particularly relevant as the U.S. faces another potential government shutdown, with foreign aid to Ukraine among the contentious issues. Shah’s approach suggests that appealing to shared values and moral principles might be a more effective strategy than relying solely on “hard-nosed national security” arguments.

While Shah’s work was in the realm of humanitarian assistance, his methods could be instructive for those navigating the current political climate, where even the virtues of democracy are under debate. In a media environment that allows for the dismissal of factual reports, perhaps a campaign built around shared values and religious beliefs could be more effective.

#### Thoughts

As the nation grapples with divisive issues like foreign aid, Shah’s story serves as a reminder that sometimes the most effective arguments are those that speak to our shared humanity. It’s a lesson that could prove invaluable for policymakers trying to navigate the complex and often contentious world of foreign aid and international relations.
