In recent years, the topic of internet infrastructure in America has gained traction, particularly given the integral role that the internet plays in modern society. Despite being a developed nation, the U.S. faces significant challenges regarding internet accessibility, cost, and competition among service providers. Let’s delves into these issues, shedding light on the hurdles that lay in the path of establishing a robust and equitable internet infrastructure across the country.

### Lack of Infrastructure and Rural Access

One of the glaring issues is the lack of high-speed internet infrastructure in several areas. Over 8.5 million households and small businesses are situated in regions devoid of high-speed internet infrastructure, which significantly hampers their ability to participate in the digital economy. This issue is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where investments in internet infrastructure have been insufficient. For instance, despite the 2018 Farm Bill’s provisions, at least 90% of households in some proposed service areas still lack access to a minimum acceptable level of broadband service.

The government has been making strides to amend this, with recent investments like $63 million by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve internet access in rural areas across Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Mississippi. Additionally, $20 million has been allocated for planning high-speed internet projects in rural communities, aiming to develop and expand broadband cooperatives.

### High Consumer Costs

Consumer costs for internet services remain high, a challenge exacerbated by the lack of competition among service providers. A survey reveals that the median monthly broadband bill, inclusive of taxes and fees, stands at about $70. Interestingly, the costs are observed to be lower in areas with more competition. This high cost of internet services can be a significant barrier for many households, particularly those in lower-income brackets.

### Lack of Competition

The market for internet service providers (ISPs) in America is notably lacking in competition. A report indicates that the service territories of the largest ISPs, such as Comcast, Charter, AT&amp;T, Verizon, CenturyLink, Frontier, and Windstream, exhibit a dire lack of real competition, leading to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. Consumer Reports also emphasizes the plight of consumers who are saddled with confusing bills, high prices, and a lack of competitive choices due to this lack of competition.

### Moving Forward

Efforts like the Biden-Harris administration’s Internet for All Initiative and the allocation of over $930 million to expand the middle-mile high-speed internet infrastructure across 35 states and Puerto Rico are commendable steps towards addressing these issues. Moreover, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has earmarked a historic $65 billion investment to expand affordable and reliable high-speed internet access across communities in the U.S.
