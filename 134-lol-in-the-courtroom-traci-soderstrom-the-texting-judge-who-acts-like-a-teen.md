In an era where teenagers are often chided for their screen addiction, it turns out that even judges can’t resist the magnetic pull of the smartphone. District Judge Traci Soderstrom of Oklahoma has recently found herself in hot water for her texting habits, which are eerily similar to those of an average American teenager. The kicker? Her texting spree could cost her a seat on the bench. Let’s explore this uncanny parallel.

### The Texting Spree: A Career on the Line

Just like a teenager engrossed in a group chat, Soderstrom sent over 500 texts during a murder trial. While teens might be discussing the latest TikTok trends or planning a weekend hangout, Soderstrom was busy texting her bailiff about the trial proceedings. The Oklahoma Supreme Court Council on Judicial Complaints is now recommending her removal, putting her career in jeopardy.

### Emoji Game Strong, But at What Cost?

Emojis are the universal language of the youth, and it appears Soderstrom is fluent. She even sent a laughing emoji to her bailiff during the trial. If that doesn’t scream “teenager,” I don’t know what does. But unlike a teen’s casual chat, her emoji use could be a nail in the coffin of her judicial career.

### The Casual Commentary: More Than Just Gossip

Teenagers are known for their candid remarks, and Soderstrom fits right in. She questioned whether a juror was wearing a wig and if a witness had teeth. She even called a police officer “pretty” and said she could look at him all day. Sounds like the kind of commentary you’d find in a high school group chat, doesn’t it? Except in this case, it’s part of an investigation that could lead to her removal.

### The “It Can Wait” Mentality: A Lesson Unlearned

When confronted about her texting habits, Soderstrom said her texting “probably could have waited.” This laid-back attitude is something we often associate with teenagers who think they can multitask between texting and, say, doing homework. In Soderstrom’s case, however, the stakes are sky-high, and her casual approach might cost her dearly. While it’s amusing to draw parallels between Judge Traci Soderstrom and an average American teenager, the implications of her actions are far more serious. Her texting during a murder trial is a breach of professional conduct that could result in her removal from the bench. So, as we chuckle at the thought of a judge acting like a teen, let’s also ponder the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences that come with it.
