**Three Indiana Educators Leading the Way: A Spotlight on Leadership**

In the heartland of America, three remarkable women are shaping the future of education, science, and public policy. Dr. Maureen Harrington, Dr. Mary Ritke Jones, and Professor Sheila Suess Kennedy are not just educators; they are trailblazers, leading with vision, innovation, and a commitment to excellence. I have had the good fortune to know each of these women and in some small way say thank you for their influence on me personally.

#### **Dr. Maureen Harrington: A Pioneer in Medical Education**

At the IU School of Medicine, Dr. Maureen Harrington has been instrumental in transforming medical education. As the associate dean for Medical Student Education-Foundational Sciences, she led the creation of a new curriculum in 2016, emphasizing collaboration and gender equality.

Her research in cell biology and her leadership in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) have positioned her as a leading voice in medical science. Dr. Harrington’s approachable leadership style and advocacy for women in science have made her a beloved figure among students and colleagues alike.

#### **Dr. Mary Ritke Jones: A Lifelong Explorer of Molecular Mysteries**

Dr. Mary Ritke’s 30-year journey in molecular and cell biology has been marked by curiosity and innovation. Her work on topoisomerases, transcriptional regulation, and mRNA turnover has contributed to the understanding of drug resistance in leukemia.

Now retired and a Professor Emeritus at the University of Indianapolis, Dr. Ritke’s legacy extends beyond the laboratory. Her experience in historic DNA analysis, consulting, and her active role in promoting science literacy reflect a multifaceted leadership that inspires the next generation of scientists.

#### **Professor Sheila Suess Kennedy: A Champion of Civic Literacy**

Professor Sheila Suess Kennedy’s career is a testament to the power of civic engagement. An Emerita Professor of Law and Public Policy at IUPUI, she has worn many hats: lawyer, political candidate, business leader, and civil rights advocate.

Author of nine books and founder of the Center for Civic Literacy at IUPUI, Professor Kennedy’s leadership transcends academia. Her daily blog and regular columns in the Indianapolis Business Journal provide insightful commentary on law, politics, and public policy.

Her retirement in 2020 marked the end of an era, but her influence continues to resonate, fostering a culture of critical thinking and responsible citizenship.

### **Leaders Shaping the Future**

These three women from Central Indiana are more than educators; they are leaders shaping the future. Their work in medical education, molecular biology, and civic literacy represents a confluence of intellect, innovation, and integrity.

In a world where leadership is often defined by titles and accolades, Dr. Harrington, Dr. Ritke, and Professor Kennedy remind us that true leadership is about vision, collaboration, and the relentless pursuit of excellence.

Their stories are not just a celebration of women in leadership but a testament to the transformative power of education. They are the guiding lights, illuminating the path for others to follow, right here in the heart of America.
