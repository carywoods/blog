Growing up in Indianapolis, I was surrounded by a tapestry of diverse families. Each had its own rhythm, its own challenges, and its own strengths. But one thing stood out to me as I navigated my childhood and adolescence: I was one of the black children raised in a two-parent household.

In a recent article by Nicholas Kristof titled “The One Privilege Liberals Ignore,” published in the NY Times, the author delves into the significant impact of the two-parent household on child poverty and overall well-being. As Kristof points out, “Families headed by single mothers are five times as likely to live in poverty as married-couple families.” Moreover, “only 38 percent of Black children live with married parents.”

These statistics resonate deeply with my personal experience. While I was fortunate to have the stability and support of both parents, many of my peers weren’t as lucky. The challenges they faced, from economic hardships to the emotional toll of a missing parental figure, were palpable.

But why is this topic so rarely discussed, especially among liberals? As Kristof suggests, there’s a reluctance to address the breakdown of the family unit, particularly among working-class whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. This reluctance is often rooted in fear—fear of appearing patronizing or racist.

However, avoiding this conversation does a disservice to the countless children growing up in single-parent households. By not acknowledging the “two-parent privilege,” we fail to address the systemic issues that contribute to family breakdowns, such as mass incarceration and the collapse of earnings for working-class men.

I remember the community gatherings in Indianapolis, where the topic of family structure was often tiptoed around. Yet, in hushed conversations, many expressed the desire for a stable two-parent household for their children. They recognized the benefits, both economic and emotional.

Harvard’s Opportunity Insights group found that “upward mobility was more likely for Black boys in neighborhoods with a higher share of Black dads living with their children.” This finding underscores the importance of acknowledging and addressing the challenges faced by single-parent households.

As we reflect on the state of families in America, it’s crucial to recognize the “two-parent privilege” and work towards solutions that support all family structures. Whether it’s strengthening labor unions, supporting community colleges, or promoting skills training initiatives, there’s much work to be done.

In Indianapolis and across the nation, every child deserves the chance to thrive, regardless of their family structure. By acknowledging the challenges and working towards solutions, we can ensure a brighter future for all. Thank you, Mom &amp; Dad.
