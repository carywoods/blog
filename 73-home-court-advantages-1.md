As some of you may already know, I live in central Indiana in a town called Zionsville. I grew up here and like everywhere there are the special bits. As a kid from Indiana, from time to time I decided to write about the special bits and will be doing so in regular series I am calling “Home Court Advantages”. Now, if you grow up in the only town in America where the Rolls Royce dealership is right next to the Dairy Queen, there are any number of advantages, simplicity meets elegance.

Today, we are going to start out by talking about the institutions of higher education. Some time down the road there will be a discussion on other schools but folks in Indiana have some better than average options and we will open up with a discussion of a hidden gem we share with the entire country, the American College of Education. Full disclosure, I had the good fortune to do some curriculum development work for the current assistant provost for Healthcare Professions, Dr. Luster Fowler Ph.D.
