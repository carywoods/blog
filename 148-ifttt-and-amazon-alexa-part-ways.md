Unexpectedly, Amazon has announced the discontinuation of its Alexa service’s integration with IFTTT (If This Then That), effective October 31st, 2023. This decision marks the end of a fruitful partnership between the two platforms, which many users have come to rely on for a seamless smart home experience.

IFTTT, a popular automation platform, allows users to create “applets” or small scripts that can trigger actions on a wide variety of services based on certain conditions. For many, the ability to connect Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa, to IFTTT was a game-changer. From controlling lights and music, to integrating with task management apps, the synergy between Alexa and IFTTT offered users a plethora of functionalities to enhance their daily routines.

The IFTTT team expressed its disappointment over the recent development, highlighting that many of their staff members personally utilize the Alexa-IFTTT integration. However, they also emphasized understanding the complexities of business decisions and the inevitable evolution of tech integrations.

For current users of the Alexa-IFTTT pairing, there’s a silver lining. IFTTT is encouraging users to update their Alexa Applets to utilize alternative triggers before the October deadline. Additionally, starting November 1st, applets that employ the “Say a specific phrase” trigger will transition to the IFTTT Button Widget. Meanwhile, any applets making use of Amazon Alexa triggers, other than the aforementioned phrase, or any Amazon Alexa query, will be archived if they aren’t updated to a different trigger or query before the cut-off.

While this shift may initially pose challenges for some users, it’s a testament to the ever-changing landscape of the tech world. As one door closes, another opens, and users are likely to see new, innovative solutions emerge in the near future. For now, those invested in the Alexa-IFTTT integration should prepare for the transition and explore alternative avenues to maintain their smart home ecosystems.
